# Radial Basis Function Network with K-Means

This project implements a **Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Network** for classification tasks, using **K-Means clustering** to determine hidden layer prototypes. It also includes a Jupyter Notebook (`rbf.ipynb`) for experimentation and visualization.

## Overview
- **Goal**: Explore RBF neural networks for supervised classification.
- **Key Features**:
  - Custom **K-Means implementation** (`kmeans.py`) for unsupervised clustering.
  - RBF network (`rbf_net.py`) with hidden layer activations based on cluster prototypes.
  - Linear regression-based weight training between hidden and output layers.
  - Functions for prediction, accuracy scoring, and confusion matrix generation.
  - Visualization utilities for predictions and clustering.
