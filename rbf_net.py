The regression is between the hidden layer activation (to the data) and the correct classes of each training sample. To solve for the weights going FROM all of the hidden units TO output unit c, recode the class vector `y` to 1s and 0s:
            1 if the class of a data sample in `y` is c
            0 if the class of a data sample in `y` is not c

        - Remember to initialize the network (set hidden unit prototypes and sigmas based on data).
        - Pay attention to the shape of self.wts in the constructor above. Yours needs to match.
